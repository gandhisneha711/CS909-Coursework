4.	Cluster Evaluation using clusteval library
The code for this is in the code file.

The similarity between the two clusterings:
	cluster_similarity(cl$clustering, hc.grps)
[1] 0.3455184
cluster_similarity(cl$clustering, km$cluster)
[1] 0.2370722
cluster_similarity(km$cluster, hc.grps)
[1] 0.1374583


For a set of clustering labels, this function computes the comembership of all pairs of observations. Basically, two observations are said to be comembers if they are clustered together.
set.seed(42)
n <- 10
labels <- sample.int(d, n, replace = TRUE)
comembership_out <- comembership(labels)
comembership_out
 [1] 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
# Notice that the number of comemberships is 'n choose 2'.
length(comembership_out) == choose(n, 2)
[1] TRUE

	Do the above for n>10 for bigger comembership_out.
	Can also do cluster stability test by using clustomitout function.
